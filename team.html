        <h2>Aadhya Kumar — Founder</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Aadhya Kumar, a junior at the International Academy Okma Campus and the founder of Neuro-Networks. I started this organization to raise awareness about brachial plexus injuries, support research and advocacy, and empower young people living with disabilities.</p>

        <p>Growing up with a brachial plexus injury shaped how I see resilience, community, and possibility—and I wanted to create a platform that helps others feel seen, supported, and limitless.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I practice Taekwondo, participate in Model United Nations as a Head Delegate, and serve as a board member of my school’s Pre-Med Club where I give human anatomy lectures. I am also heavily involved in the Indian American Student Association. I love learning how leadership and medicine intersect to create real-world impact.</p>

        <div class="book-img">Upload Book Cover Here</div>

        <p><strong>Built Differently: Growing Up With a Brachial Plexus Injury</strong> is a memoir authored by Aadhya Kumar that shares the wins, challenges, and realities of growing up with a disability.</p>

        <p>Writing this book expanded my advocacy beyond storytelling. As I shared my experiences, I realized how little awareness there is about brachial plexus injuries and how many young people feel isolated or misunderstood. That realization led to the creation of Neuro-Networks.</p>
