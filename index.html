<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>
Neuro-Networks Foundation is dedicated to educating youth, advancing awareness and advocacy for brachial plexus injury research, and empowering individuals living with brachial plexus injuries to thrive without limits. Through structured education programs, community-building initiatives, and research-focused fundraising, we bridge the gap between complex medical knowledge and youth understanding. Our mission is rooted in representation, inclusion, and leadership.

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<p>
Brachial plexus injuries (BPI) affect the network of nerves that control movement and sensation in the shoulder, arm, and hand. These injuries can occur at birth (Obstetric Brachial Plexus Injury) or later due to trauma.
