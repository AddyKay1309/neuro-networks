<h2>Networks of Knowledge, Strength, and Resilience</h2>
<p>Advancing education, advocacy, and empowerment for individuals living with brachial plexus injuries.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>About Neuro-Networks</h3>
<p>
Neuro-Networks Foundation was established to address a critical gap in public understanding, youth education, and research advocacy surrounding brachial plexus injuries (BPI). Despite affecting thousands of individuals nationwide, brachial plexus injuries remain significantly underrepresented in school curricula, youth medical discussions, and mainstream awareness efforts.
</p>

<p>
Our foundation bridges that gap by translating complex neurological and orthopedic medical concepts into accessible, youth-centered education. Through structured programming, school partnerships, research fundraising initiatives, and storytelling platforms, we build communities rooted in empathy, knowledge, and representation.
</p>

<p>
We believe awareness is not passive — it is transformative. When students understand neurological injuries, stigma decreases, inclusion increases, and leadership emerges. Neuro-Networks exists to cultivate that transformation.

<h3>The Reality of Brachial Plexus Injury</h3>

<p>
The brachial plexus is a network of nerves originating in the spinal cord that controls movement and sensation in the shoulder, arm, and hand. Injury to this network can result in weakness, paralysis, chronic pain, or long-term mobility limitations.
</p>

<div class="stats">

<div class="stat-box">
<h4>1–3 per 1,000 births</h4>
<p>Obstetric brachial plexus injuries occur in approximately 1–3 out of every 1,000 live births in the United States.</p>
</div>

<div class="stat-box">
<h4>20–30%</h4>
<p>Of affected infants experience incomplete natural recovery and may require surgical intervention.</p>
</div>

<div class="stat-box">
<h4>Lifetime Impact</h4>
<p>Many individuals navigate long-term physical, psychological, and social challenges due to limited awareness and accessibility.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>
While medical advancements continue, funding disparities and awareness gaps persist. Neuro-Networks supports efforts to ensure that individuals living with BPI are not overlooked in research or representation.

<div class="section">
<h3>Our Three Pillars</h3>

<div class="card">
<h4>Educate</h4>
<p>
We design and deliver youth-focused educational workshops, medical breakdowns, digital content, and school presentations that increase understanding of brachial plexus injuries. Knowledge builds empathy, and empathy builds inclusive communities.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h4>Advocate</h4>
<p>
We collaborate with researchers, hospitals, and community partners to expand funding streams and amplify awareness efforts. Advocacy connects youth leadership with medical innovation.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h4>Empower</h4>
<p>
Through mentorship initiatives, storytelling campaigns, and representation-driven programming, we highlight resilience and redefine limitation narratives. Empowerment begins with visibility.
