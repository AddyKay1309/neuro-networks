<p>Educating. Advocating. Empowering.</p>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>
Neuro-Networks is dedicated to educating youth, raising awareness and advocacy for brachial plexus injury research, and empowering individuals with brachial plexus injuries to live without limits through education, community, and representation.
</p>

<p>
We believe that awareness is transformative. When students are informed about neurological injuries, stigma decreases, inclusion strengthens, and leadership grows. Through structured education programs, partnerships, fundraising initiatives, and storytelling platforms, Neuro-Networks builds communities rooted in knowledge, empathy, and resilience.

<div class="section">
<h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>

<p>
Brachial plexus injuries are significantly underrepresented in public education and research awareness. Many affected youth face stigma, misunderstanding, and limited peer support. Without accessible information and representation, individuals living with brachial plexus injuries often navigate their journeys in isolation.
</p>

<p>
Neuro-Networks bridges the gap between medical knowledge and youth understanding through education, advocacy, and empowerment. By making complex medical information accessible and fostering community dialogue, we create inclusive spaces where difference is understood rather than overlooked.

<h3>The Reality of Brachial Plexus Injury</h3>

<p>
The brachial plexus is a network of nerves originating from the spinal cord that controls movement and sensation in the shoulder, arm, and hand. Injury to this network can result in weakness, paralysis, limited mobility, chronic pain, and long-term functional challenges.
</p>

<div class="stats">

<div class="stat-box">
<h4>1–3 per 1,000 births</h4>
<p>Obstetric brachial plexus injuries occur in approximately 1–3 out of every 1,000 live births in the United States.</p>
</div>

<div class="stat-box">
<h4>20–30% Require Surgery</h4>
<p>A significant percentage of severe cases do not fully recover spontaneously and require surgical intervention.</p>
</div>

<div class="stat-box">
<h4>Long-Term Impact</h4>
<p>Thousands of individuals live with lasting physical and psychosocial effects due to limited awareness and accessibility.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">
Despite these numbers, funding disparities and awareness gaps persist. Neuro-Networks advocates for equitable research attention and inclusive representation within youth communities.
